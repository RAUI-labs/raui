For Mîm came of Dwarves that were banished in ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east and long before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward into Beleriand; but they became diminished in stature and in smith-craft and they took to lives of stealth walking with bowed shoulders and furtive steps Before the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost came west over the mountains the Elves of Beleriand knew not what these others were and they hunted them and slew them; but afterwards they let them alone and they were called Noegyth Nibin the Petty-Dwarves in the Sindarin tongue They loved none but themselves and if they feared and hated the Orcs they hated the Eldar no less and the Exiles most of all; for the Noldor they said had stolen their lands and their homes Long ere King Finrod Felagund came over the Sea the caves of Nargothrond were discovered by them and by them its delving was begun; and beneath the crown of Amon Rûdh the Bald Hill the slow hands of the Petty-Dwarves had bored and deepened the caves through the long years that they dwelt there untroubled by the Grey-elves of the woods But now at last they had dwindled and died out of Middle-earth all save Mîm and his two sons; and Mîm was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves old and forgotten And in his halls the smithies were idle and the axes rusted and their name was remembered only in ancient tales of Doriath and Nargothrond
