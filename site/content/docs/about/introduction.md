## About

RAUI is designed to be flexible and easy-to-use, allowing you to quickly build your own UI components by combining existing components into more elaborate structures. The main idea behind the RAUI architecture is to treat the UI as data that gets transformed into rendering data for your renderer of choice.

## API Docs

For a more in-depth explanation of the RAUI architecture see the [API documentation][api]. The API docs have explanations of each piece of RAUI and how the everything is put together.
