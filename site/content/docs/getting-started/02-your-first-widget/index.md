## What is a Widget?

Before we create a widget, let's talk about what a widget actually _is_. To be precise, there are a few different types of widgets and the type widget that we will be creating is a **_widget component_**. Widget components are made out of normal Rust functions that have a specific signature. The job of widget components is to look at it's properties and child widgets ( if it has any ), to do any processing that it needs to, and to output a new widget tree that will rendered in place of the component.

Because components can return whole new widget trees, they can combine the functionality of multiple _other_ components together. This allows you to build components into larger structures like LEGOÂ® bricks, where a complex UI can be made out of many simple pieces put together in different combinations. This high modularity is the true power of RAUI, your imagination is the only limit!

## Making a Widget

Without further ado, let's make a widget!

Update your `main.rs` file to look like this:

{{ rust_code_snippet(path="rust/guide_02/src/main.rs")}}

There's plenty of comments in the above example, but there's a lot going on here so lets break it down piece by piece.

### Setting the Widget Tree

The first thing we changed was to add our app component to the widget tree in our `RauiQuickStartBuilder`.

{{ rust_code_snippet(path="rust/guide_02/src/main.rs", start=9, end=16)}}

Every RAUI app has a root widget tree that holds the whole structure of application in it. It is essentially the "main" of the UI. In this case we set our widget to a single `app` component. This is the `app` component that we define in the function below.

Here we use the strategy of keeping our root widget tree very simple and putting all of our real logic in the `app` component.

### The `app` Component

Now we get to the definition of our `app` component:

{{ rust_code_snippet(path="rust/guide_02/src/main.rs", start=30, end=30)}}

As we mentioned before, components are just normal Rust functions with a specific signature. Components are required to take a [`WidgetContext`] as an argument and they must return a [`WidgetNode`].

[`WidgetContext`]: https://docs.rs/raui/latest/raui/core/widget/context/struct.WidgetContext.html
[`WidgetNode`]: https://docs.rs/raui/latest/raui/core/widget/node/enum.WidgetNode.html

#### [`WidgetContext`]

The widget context is the way that a widget can access it's own state, properties, children, and other information that may be important to the function of the widget. It also allows the widget to respond to events or send messages to other widgets. We will learn more about the [`WidgetContext`] later.

#### [`WidgetNode`]

That brings us to what a **widget _node_** is. As we mentioned above, there are a few different kinds of _widgets_. Widget components are one of them and widget nodes are another. The easiest way to think of a [`WidgetNode`] is that it is a tree of other widgets. [`WidgetNode`]s are most commonly created with the [`widget!`] macro.

> **Note:** There is a third kind of widget is called a [`WidgetUnit`], but you don't usually need to think about those.

We can see the [`widget!`] macro in action in our example:

{{ rust_code_snippet(path="rust/guide_02/src/main.rs", start=56, end=65)}}

We use the widget macro to create a simple tree with a single [`text_box`] component in it and we apply our `text_box_props` to it to configure how the text box renders the text inside.

[`text_box`]: https://docs.rs/raui/latest/raui/core/widget/component/text_box/fn.text_box.html

[`widget!`]: https://docs.rs/raui/latest/raui/core/macro.widget.html
[`WidgetUnit`]: https://docs.rs/raui/latest/raui/core/widget/unit/enum.WidgetUnit.html

#### Properties

That brings us to the concept of **_properties_**. Properties are data, made up of Rust structs, that can be applied to components additively to customize their behavior.

In this case we created [`TextBoxProps`] data that we used to configure the [`text_box`] component.

{{ rust_code_snippet(path="rust/guide_02/src/main.rs", start=38, end=52)}}

We use the properties to configure the font, content, and color of our text.

We are not limited to using just one struct for our property data. We could add any number of different properties structs to our component, allowing us to configure how the component responds to layout, for instance. We will see how to do more of that later.

[`TextBoxProps`]: https://docs.rs/raui/0.34.0/raui/core/widget/component/text_box/struct.TextBoxProps.html

> **Note:** You can download the [Verdana] font or use your own font to follow along. We chose to place it in a `resources/` folder adjacent to our `Cargo.toml` file in our Rust project, but you can place it wherever you like as long as you update the path to the font in the [`TextBoxProps`].

## Summary

Now that we've explained it all, go try it out! When you `cargo run` you should get a window displaying your "Hello World!".
